# Extra-Large and Light Ruler-based Calipers

Calipers made with flat metal rules are great, but what happens if you want
measure something that's more than a couple of centimeters in depth, such as
vases, pots and bottles. Well, you extend the heck out of it!

Print one of each model, using supports for the extending rods' holes. Stick
a 3mm rod of aluminium in each of the holes, and add a little Sugru at the
end of the rods to avoid scratches from the bare metal.
